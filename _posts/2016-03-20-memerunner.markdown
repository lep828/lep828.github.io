description: After two weeks of learning code I made Meme Runner using JavaScript and jQuery. Drawing inspiration from a personal favourite of mine - Flappy Bird. This was a 3 day project which quickly taught me the importance of planning.
description2: If I have more time in the future, I will make it responsive and work for mobiles and possibly add more playable characters.
